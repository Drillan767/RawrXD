# RawrXD (v 2.0)

This is a naive try to create sort of Ruby on Rails based CMS, where there can only be ONE user. The website is thought to be used as a haven: a user with no skill in web development can use this for free to create and personnalize his website so he can win time and actually write stuff and show what he can do.


"Rawr" stands for **Ra**ils, **W**ebpack, **R**eact. "XD" stands for **cancer**.

Please don't create PR or similar stuff, I don't even know where I'm going so far.
